## CS772 : Deep Learning for NLP : Assignment 2

This is our attempt at the second assignment of the course CS772.  

First create a python virtual environment and then install all dependencies using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The learned weights of the final model are loaded in the form of a pickled in the UI for inference. They can be found in `model_3000_10.pkl`

To boot up the User Interface for model inference    

```bash
python3 ui.py
```
